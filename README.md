# Welcome to the Frog-Leap-Game
# Basic rules of the game
The left set of frogs can only move right, the right set of frogs can only move left.
Frogs can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from opposite side.
The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions.
Always choose a number between 0 to 6 else you will get a ValueError.
'-' denotes the empty space or you can say empty leaf so make sure you don't choose the number belongs to the empty leaf.
This game looks easy but I can tell you it is not!.
